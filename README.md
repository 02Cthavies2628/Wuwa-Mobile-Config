# WuWa Mobile Config — Personal 3.6 Build

Performance and graphics configuration presets for **Wuthering Waves Mobile (Version 3.6)**, compiled and cleaned up across eight tiers: four **All Devices** presets and four **Snapdragon**-specific presets.

This is a personally maintained compilation built by pulling current files from Arglax's [Mobile-WuWa-Config](https://github.com/Arglax/Mobile-WuWa-Config) repo (All Devices side, restructured for 3.6) and a Snapdragon-specific source in the same style as AlteriaX/Geilan63lan's Adreno-focused configs, then auditing every file for bugs, dead CVars, and version consistency. It is **not** an official redistribution of either project — see Credits below.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
All Devices/
├── Low End/
├── Balanced Performance/
├── Balanced Visual/
└── High End/

Snapdragon/
├── Low End/
├── Balanced Performance/
├── Balanced Visual/
└── High End/
```

Each folder contains an `Engine.ini` and a `DeviceProfiles.ini`.

**All Devices** — general presets for Mali, PowerVR, Xclipse, Unisoc, and other non-Snapdragon Android GPUs.
**Snapdragon** — presets with Adreno-specific device family mapping and tuning. Generally scored higher than their All Devices counterpart at the same nominal tier, since Adreno drivers tend to sustain performance better than budget Mali/PowerVR silicon.

---

## 📌 Installation

1. Choose either the **All Devices** or **Snapdragon** folder based on your chipset.
2. Pick the tier that matches your device (see below).
3. Copy `Engine.ini` and `DeviceProfiles.ini` into:

```text
Internal Storage/Android/data/
com.kurogame.wutheringwaves.global/files/
UE4Game/Client/Client/Saved/Config/Android/
```

4. Overwrite existing files when prompted.
5. Launch the game normally.

> On newer Android versions you may need Shizuku, ZArchiver, MT Manager, or another Android data folder access solution to reach that path.

## ⚙️ Tier Guide

| Tier | Goal | Typical Chipsets (rough guide) |
|---|---|---|
| **Low End** | Maximum smoothness over visuals | Snapdragon 660–680, Helio G85/G88/G99, Dimensity 700/810, older Mali/PowerVR |
| **Balanced Performance** | Stable FPS with acceptable visuals | Snapdragon 720G–855, Dimensity 900–1080, mid-range Mali G57/G68 |
| **Balanced Visual** | Better visuals without sacrificing stability | Snapdragon 870–7+ Gen 2, Dimensity 1200–8020, Mali G715/G78 |
| **High End** | Maximum visual quality, flagship hardware | Snapdragon 8 Gen 1–8 Elite, Dimensity 9000–9400, Mali G925 |

Some tiers use a single file with a **profile-name toggle** rather than fully separate configs — check the top of `DeviceProfiles.ini` and `Engine.ini` for a commented-out alternate profile line (e.g. swapping `Android_High` for `Android_Adreno840`) if you own a flagship Adreno chip but want a lighter preset while still unlocking chip-exclusive features like Frame Gen.

## 🎮 Frame Generation

Several tiers (Balanced Performance and up) include `r.KuroFI.*` settings. Actual availability depends on your device, graphics API, and Kuro's implementation — not every device will benefit. Both **Low End** tiers disable Frame Interpolation entirely; it's pure overhead with no upside on weak hardware.

## 🛠️ What Changed in This Compilation

### 1. Version headers updated 3.5 → 3.6
Several source files still carried 3.5-era headers despite 3.6 content/structure changes upstream (notably Arglax's move to a `dp.Override` profile-forcing system on some tiers, replacing the old `DeviceScore`/`BaseProfileName` GPU auto-detection). Headers were corrected across all eight tiers.

### 2. Casing normalized (`Cvars=` → `CVars=`)
The engine's ini key is case-sensitive as `CVars`. Several source files inconsistently mixed `Cvars=` and `CVars=` within the same file (usually the first few lines). Normalized throughout — affected nearly every tier's `DeviceProfiles.ini`.

### 3. Forbidden CVar removed: `r.ScreenPercentage`
This CVar is on Kuro's `ConfigMonitor` blacklist — setting it does nothing; the engine strips it at runtime. It appeared (and was doing nothing) in:
- All Devices Balanced Visual & High End
- Snapdragon Balanced Visual & High End

Commented out with an explanatory note rather than silently deleted, so the intent is preserved in case a future patch un-blacklists it.

### 4. Duplicate-key bug fixed: `r.ScreenSizeCullRatioFactor`
Both the All Devices and Snapdragon **Balanced Performance** `Engine.ini` files set this CVar twice in the same section (`2.5` near the top, a stray `5` further down) — same section, same key, so only the last value actually applied, silently overriding the intended `2.5` with the Low-End tier's more aggressive culling value. The stray duplicate was removed.

### 5. Structural change for 3.6 (Stable Configs tiers)
Arglax's repo restructured the device-matching system on the `Stable Configs` tiers: instead of the engine auto-detecting a GPU and scoring it against a `DeviceScore`, `dp.Override` in `Engine.ini` now force-assigns every device directly to a named profile. The old GPU-family mapping blocks (dozens of `[Android_Mali_*]`/`[Android_Adreno*]` sections) are no longer needed on those tiers. Reflected accordingly in the All Devices Low/Mid/High-End files.

### 6. Reconstructed files (flagged, not verified)
Two files in this set could not be pulled from a live, verified source and were built by extrapolating from adjacent tiers instead:
- **All Devices High End `Engine.ini`** — built from the Low/Balanced Performance/Balanced Visual progression pattern before the correct source file was located.
- **Snapdragon Low End `Engine.ini`** — built by applying the same 3.5→3.6 structural changes seen on the All Devices Low End file to the user's existing Snapdragon-tuned v3.5 file.

Both are marked in-file. Treat these two specifically as best-effort drafts — check `Client.log` after installing to confirm the CVars are actually being read.

### 7. Balanced Visual (Snapdragon) manually tuned toward visuals
Per request, nudged texture quality, post-process quality, mip bias, ambient occlusion quality, foliage/grass density, and mesh LOD distance upward, while deliberately leaving shadow quality, effects quality, and anti-aliasing untouched — keeping it inside "balanced" rather than drifting into High-End territory. This is a manual adjustment, not sourced from any repo.

## ⚠️ Known Issues Left As-Is

These were flagged during review but **not** silently resolved, since guessing the "correct" value risks being wrong in the opposite direction:

**Engine.ini vs. DeviceProfiles.ini conflicts** (same CVar, different value, in different files — priority between the two isn't consistently documented upstream):

| Tier | CVar(s) | Engine.ini | DeviceProfiles.ini |
|---|---|---|---|
| All Devices Balanced Visual | `foliage.DensityScale` | 0.5 | 1.0 |
| | `r.StaticMeshLODDistanceScale` | 1.0 | 0.8 |
| All Devices High End | `r.LightShaftNumSamples` | 16 | 12 (in-file, different section) |
| | `r.LightShaftQuality` | 1 | 2 (in-file, different section) |
| | `r.Mobile.WaterSSRStep` | 32 | 128 (in-file, different section) |
| | `wp.Runtime.LoadingRangeScale`/`PlannedLoadingRangeScale` | 0.8 / 1.1 | 0.85 / 1.05 |
| Snapdragon Balanced Visual | `foliage.DensityScale` | 0.5 | 1.4 (post-tuning) |
| | `r.StaticMeshLODDistanceScale` | 1.0 | 0.6 (post-tuning) |
| Snapdragon High End | `r.StaticMeshLODDistanceScale` | 0.95 | 0.5 |

**Unverified CVars carried forward** (plausible, not confirmed against any tested reference — watch closely if you install):
- `r.GSR.Enabled` (Snapdragon tiers) — Qualcomm's GSR upscaler plugin exists in-engine, but no `r.GSR.*` CVar is confirmed in any reference source.
- `r.PSO.LRUCapacity` — plausible shader-cache CVar, not seen in any reference file.
- `fx.Niagara.QualityLevel` (Balanced Visual and up) — not confirmed in current-gen tiers.

**VRS is disabled by default** on Balanced Visual and High End (both folders). Left as commented-out lines using the actual deprecated CVar names (`r.VRS.EnableImage`, `r.VRS.ContrastAdaptiveShading`) rather than the commonly-requested-but-nonexistent `r.VRS.EnableMaterial`/`r.VRS.EnableMesh`, in case you want to test separately at your own risk.

**Minor naming oddities noted, not changed:**
- All Devices High End: `r.Kuro.Foliage.MobileSuperFarCullDistanceMax` equals `MobileFarCullDistanceMax` exactly (15000) — "Super Far" usually should exceed "Far."
- Snapdragon High End: `r.Kuro.Foliage.MobileNearCullDistanceMax` equals `MobileMiddleCullDistanceMax` exactly (15000) — same pattern.
- Snapdragon High End: `r.Kuro.KuroBloomStreak=0`, down from `1` at Balanced Visual — bloom streak effectively turns off going up a tier, which reads backwards but may be intentional (bloom streak can look overblown at high internal resolution).
